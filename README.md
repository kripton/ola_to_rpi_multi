# ola_to_rpi_multi

Allows a Raspberry Pi to output multiple DMX universes.
Based on the code of Jonathan Andrews (http://www.jonshouse.co.uk/rpidmx512.cgi)

## Getting Started

Optionally, with qmake installed, run ```qmake```. Nevertheless, I provided
a minimal Makefile so qmake is not strictly needed.

### Prerequisites

* Open Lighting Architecture (OLA) running on the Pi: https://www.openlighting.org/ola/
* PiGPIO library: http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/index.html
